                <p> 
                I'm a multi-award nominated freelance journalist, writing on a wide range of topics from Film & TV to women's health!.
                I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Public Health (MPH) at the University of Nottingham, with hopes that this will lead on to PhD research in the field of 
                women's health disparities. 
                I completed my BA in Journalism, Media, and Sociology from Cardiff University in 2020. <br><br>

                During my time in Cardiff, I had the pleasure of working closely across the university's award-winning media platforms; 
                Quench Magazine, Gair Rhydd Newspaper and Xpress Radio. In 2017 I served as the Advice Editor for Gair Rhydd and had the pleasure of working with a 
                wide range of other editors to publish high quality content. I also hosted a morning talk-show on Xpress Radio where I discussed popular trends with
                my co-host. In 2018 I was appointed the Food and Drink Editor for Quench Magazine. Throughout my time at Cardiff, I was nominated for 3 Cardiff 
                Student Media Awards and had the pleasure of winning the 'Best Contributor Award' from Gair Rhydd Newspaper in 2017. <br><br>

                Since 2020, I have had the pleasure of regularly writing for several print and digital publications including Cosmopolitan UK, Refinery 29, Metro, 
                Lacuna Voices, Giddy, Nottinghamshire Live, Beauty Bay, Gal-dem and more. I am also a regular guest on BBC Asian Networks 'Debate Show' where I have spoken on a 
                number of topics, including arranged marriages and mental health. 
                I have also spoken on other radio channels such as BBC Radio 4 and BBC Radio West Midlands. <br><br>

                I'm a well-known advocate for women's health inequalities and regularly write and speak about my own experiences with dismissal and my 
                journey with Endometriosis. For Endometriosis Awareness Month in 2022, I had the pleasure of working with Freeda Media to create an awareness 
                video on the condition. 

                I am available for commissions and assignments. You can reach me at <a href="#">sarahharrisjourno@gmail.com.</a>
